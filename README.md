After implementing various sorting algorithms in PHP , I've planned to implement the necessary design patterns in PHP.

Starting with decorator pattern, I'll continue with other patterns as well. The Decorator pattern is also a useful
way to implement Open Close principle. Which is one of the most important design principle to architect large scale application.

As it is a initial commit, no description will be available right now. 

But I'll try to improve the repo in future to provide a detailed description about the design patterns and the practical
purpose to use it.
